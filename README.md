## Description

This is a portfolio showcasing my skills and talents for employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 
I am displaying the skills I learned in my coding bootcamp at UNCCharlotte: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
